<p>
This project aims to develop a microservice for a banking system to manage bank accounts. 
The microservice will be designed and implemented following best practices commonly used in the industry. 
Key components and practices employed in this project include mappers, services, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), REST API, and entities.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Mappers</b>: The project will utilize mappers to facilitate the conversion of data between different layers of the application. 
Mappers help in mapping entities to DTOs and vice versa, ensuring that data is appropriately transformed and transferred.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Services</b>: The microservice will have service classes responsible for implementing business logic and handling operations related to bank accounts. Services will encapsulate the logic required to create, update, delete, and retrieve account information, ensuring proper handling of business rules and validations.
</p>

<p>
  <b>DTOs</b>: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) will be used to transfer data between the client and the microservice. DTOs are lightweight objects that contain the necessary information without exposing internal implementation details. They help in decoupling the client from the underlying data structure and provide a standardized format for data exchange.
</p>

<p>
  <b>REST API</b>: The microservice will expose a RESTful API, adhering to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). This API will enable clients to interact with the bank account microservice using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), providing a scalable and interoperable interface.

  
</p>

<p>
  <b>Entities</b>: Entities represent the core data objects within the microservice. In the context of this project, entities will represent bank accounts, containing attributes such as account number, balance, owner information, transaction history, etc. Entities will be mapped to database tables or other persistent storage mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
  By employing these best practices, the microservice will be well-structured, maintainable, and scalable. It will provide a secure and efficient way to manage bank accounts, allowing clients to perform various operations while adhering to the principles of good software design and development.
